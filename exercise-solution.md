# Exercise 1: Fix Serialization

**Approach:**
- Review the serialization process in the `SerializationManagement` class.
- Check if the objects being serialized (`DataObject1` and `DataObject2`) are properly implementing the `Serializable` interface.
- Ensure that all fields in the objects are serializable.
- Investigate if there are any exceptions during serialization and handle them appropriately.

**Changes:**
- Confirm that `DataObject1` and `DataObject2` classes implement `Serializable`.
- Verify the serializability of all fields in both classes.
- Check for any exceptions during serialization in the `serialize` method of `SerializationManagement` and handle them.

# Exercise 2: Partial Serialization

**Approach:**
- Modify the `DataObject2` class to mark `SourceIdentifier` as `transient` to exclude it from serialization.
- Update the serialization and deserialization logic accordingly.
- Adjust the test case to verify that `SourceIdentifier` is not serialized.

**Changes:**
- In `DataObject2` class:
  ```java
  private transient String sourceIdentifier;
- Modify serialization and deserialization logic in SerializationManagement to handle the transient field.
- Update the test case to assert that SourceIdentifier is not serialized.

# Exercise 4: Improve Error Handling

**Approach:**
- Enhance error handling by providing more descriptive error messages.
- Implement diagnostic trace messages using System.err.println or logging.
- Ensure that the main application and library gracefully handle errors without crashing.

**Changes:**
- Add detailed error messages in catch blocks in serialize and deserialize methods.
- Introduce diagnostic trace messages to provide information about the serialization process.
- Verify that the main application doesn't crash on errors.

# Exercise 5: General Improvements

**Approach:**
- Review the code for general improvements such as formatting, code readability, and adherence to coding standards.
Consider refactoring any redundant or overly complex code.

**Changes:**
- Refactor code for better readability and adherence to coding standards.
Remove any redundant or unnecessary code.
